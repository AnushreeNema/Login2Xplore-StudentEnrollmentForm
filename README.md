## Project Description

This project is a web-based **Student Enrollment Form** built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JsonPowerDB. The application allows users to enter and store student information such as Roll Number, Full Name, Class, Date of Birth, Address, and Enrollment Date.

The primary key is the **Roll Number**. On entering a roll number, the form detects whether it already exists in the database:

- If not found, the form enables the user to **Save** a new record.
- If found, it fills in the existing data and enables the user to **Update** the record.

---

## Benefits of using JsonPowerDB

- No schema definition required
- Fast and lightweight
- REST API-based backend
- Secure data storage and retrieval

---

## Features

- Dynamic form validation
- Roll Number-based record lookup
- Save new student entries
- Update existing student records
- Reset form to initial state

## Deployment Notes

This project uses JsonPowerDB, which currently operates over HTTP only. However, GitHub Pages enforces HTTPS by default.

### As a result:
- The deployed version of this project on GitHub Pages does not function correctly due to blocked HTTP API requests.
- Users may see a 404 error or browser warnings about mixed content when trying to use the live version.

### How to test the project locally:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. The application will function correctly in a local environment.

### Recommendation:
To use this project in a live/hosted environment, consider one of the following:
- Use a backend that supports HTTPS.
- Set up a secure proxy to relay requests from HTTPS to HTTP safely.
